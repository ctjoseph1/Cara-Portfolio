# Cara-Portfolio
The task at hand was to ensure that I created a portfolio page that has the following acceptance criteria:
-When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
-When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
-When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
-When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
-When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
-When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

I beleive I have met most of the acceptance criteria with this project, but in future, I would really like to learn more about ways to neaten the UI, as it doesn't look aesthetically pleasing at all. I also worked on trying to make things responsive, and for the most part it is, but there are areas where the avatar logo at the top left shrinks in a distorted way.
I look forward to learning about hover options also, as it would make the user experience more friendly. I've learnt so many new things including how to hyperlink email addresses, numbers for example so that's a great improvement to my knowledge.

Also, I was not able to link to the 'deployed applications' since they don't exist so I hope that linking them to google demonstrates my ability to at least hyperlink!
